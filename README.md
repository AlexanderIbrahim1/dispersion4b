# dispersion4b
The quadruple-dipole (or dipole-dipole-dipole-dipole) dispersion interaction energy function.

This code is based on equations (1) and (2), with N == 4, taken from:
    W. L. Bade. "Drude-Model calculation of dispersion forces. III. The fourth-order
    contribution", J. Chem Phys., 28 (1957).
